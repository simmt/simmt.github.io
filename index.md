## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my website! 

My name is Kevin Simmt and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in Comparative Political Economy, Canadian Politics and Quantitative Methods. 

My dissertation examines the regime-specific challenges that governments face when attempting to implement optimal tax policy. My political economy research informs further research into public policy and the optimal design of democratic institutions.  

In the classroom, I teach Canadian and Comparative Politics. I strive to make material relevant to the lives of students; teach complex ideas simply; and create interactive tools by which to engage students with political science theories. 

I am a proud citizen of Alberta, Canada. Outside of Political Science, I am interested in literature, hockey and bourbon. Love is blind and so is my devotion to the Edmonton Oilers. Of late, I have been exploring the small towns and countryside of the American Midwest.

## Teaching

In the classroom, I teach courses on the Canadian Political System and Comparative Politics. Additionally, I have tutored students in research design and quantitative methods; moreover, both topics loom large as components in all my courses.

I strive to teach complex ideas in simple terms, whether evaluating a quantitative method or arguing theories of distributive justice. Moreover, I seek to tie class material to the lives of my students, such that coursework lends itself to the aims of their own lives. 

At every corner, my classes incorporate original “games” to get students playing directly with the theoretical ideas at stake. This includes a game called Eschaton (a computer simulation, modelling the outcomes of student’s political decisions as they rule over their own country), hosting Model Parliaments, and debating what makes Canadian the lyrics of Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen -- amongst many other interactive ventures.
