## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my website! 

My name is Kevin Simmt and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in Comparative Political Economy, Canadian Politics and Quantitative Methods. 

My dissertation examines the regime-specific challenges that governments face when attempting to implement optimal tax policy. My political economy research informs further research into public policy and the optimal design of democratic institutions.  

In the classroom, I teach Canadian and Comparative Politics. I strive to make material relevant to the lives of students; teach complex ideas simply; and create interactive tools by which to engage students with political science theories. 

I am a proud citizen of Alberta, Canada. Outside of Political Science, I am interested in literature, hockey and bourbon. Love is blind and so is my devotion to the Edmonton Oilers. Of late, I have been exploring the small towns and countryside of the American Midwest.

## Teaching

In the classroom, I teach courses on the Canadian Political System and Comparative Politics. Additionally, I have tutored students in research design and quantitative methods; moreover, both topics loom large as components in all my courses.

I strive to teach complex ideas in simple terms, whether evaluating a quantitative method or arguing theories of distributive justice. Moreover, I seek to tie class material to the lives of my students, such that coursework lends itself to the aims of their own lives. 

At every corner, my classes incorporate original “games” to get students playing directly with the theoretical ideas at stake. This includes a game called Eschaton (a computer simulation, modelling the outcomes of student’s political decisions as they rule over their own country), hosting Model Parliaments, and debating what makes Canadian the lyrics of Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen -- amongst many other interactive ventures.

## Research

Most broadly, I am interested in the roles that governments take in modern market economies. More specifically, I study the regime-specific challenges that governments face when attempting to implement optimal tax policy. Democracies, particularly, face many traps when trying to implement tax policy, such as an efficient tax-mix. 

My work uses quantitative methods to assess theories of political economy; moreover, I engage my theoretical work with studies of optimal public policy and institutional design in order to consider what changes democracies might enact for improved operations. My most recent work seeks to identify causal effects using difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity designs.

+ Thesis Dissertation. A Theory of Planned Inefficiency: the Efficiency of Inefficient State-Owned Enterprise -- a Story in the Fallacy of Composition

Oftentimes, the political economy of taxation focuses on conflicts between income groups in order to account for variations in tax-levels and tax-progressivity. This focus, however, not only overlooks other salient cleavages, but is unable to explain aspects of taxation, such as tax-mix, for which income-based groups provide neither the most salient, nor generalizable, impetuous for conflict.

In my dissertation I write a series of papers focusing on the regime-specific challenges governments face when producing and implementing tax policy. In these papers I conceptually draw on selectorate theory and quantitatively estimate the causal effect of regime type on various aspects of tax policy through regressiondiscontinuity and difference-in-difference designs built around exogenous shocks to existing regimes.

+ Thesis Chapter. A Theory of Taxation: the Elasticity Wars & Democracy's Informality Trap

I argue that optimal tax-mix results from “planned inefficiency,” whereby governments intentionally tax the economy’s most “inelastic” elements (i.e., economic behaviours difficult to change). I then use selectorate theory to explain why democracy’s struggle to implement efficient tax policy as they seek to appease broad swaths of the public with taxes on those behaviours for which the coalition’s members are “elastic” (i.e., economic behaviours easily changed). 

I test my theory with an international dataset on taxation and imputations of informality; I find democracies use high income taxation in exactly those situations where it is least efficient: where the informal sector makes up the bulk of a country’s economic production and employment
