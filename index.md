## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Kevin Simmt and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in Political Economy, Canadian Politics, and Quantitative Methods. My dissertation examines the challenges faced by democracies and dictators alike when attempting to make and implement efficient tax policy. In the classroom, I teach courses about Canadian and Comparative Politics.

In my spare time you can find me cheering for my beloved Edmonton Oilers and exploring the American Midwest.
