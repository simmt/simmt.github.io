## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Kevin Simmt and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in Political Economy, Canadian Politics, and Quantitative Methods. You can find my cv [here](simmt_cv.pdf).

My dissertation examines the regime-specific challenges that governments face when attempting to implement optimal tax policy. In the classroom, I teach courses about Canadian and Comparative Politics.

In my spare time you can find me cheering for my beloved Edmonton Oilers and exploring the American Midwest.
