## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my website! 

My name is Kevin Simmt and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in Comparative Political Economy, Canadian Politics and Quantitative Methods. 

My dissertation examines the regime-specific challenges that governments face when attempting to implement optimal tax policy. My political economy research informs further research into public policy and the optimal design of democratic institutions.  

In the classroom, I teach Canadian and Comparative Politics. I strive to make material relevant to the lives of students; teach complex ideas simply; and create interactive tools by which to engage students with political science theories. 

I am a proud citizen of Alberta, Canada. Outside of Political Science, I am interested in literature, hockey and bourbon. Love is blind and so is my devotion to the Edmonton Oilers. Of late, I have been exploring the small towns and countryside of the American Midwest. 

You can find my cv [here](simmt_cv.pdf).
